# PartSelect Parts Assistant — Instalily Case Study

A production-deployed chat agent for the PartSelect e-commerce scenario, scoped strictly to **refrigerator** and **dishwasher** parts. The entire customer journey happens inside one chat: identity → diagnosis → part discovery → compatibility → installation guidance → cart → checkout → payment.

**Live demo:** https://customerservice.lambdapen.com
**Demo accounts:** `demo@example.com` (owns appliances, has order history) · `mike@example.com` (bought parts only — watch the appliance inference) · or continue as a guest.

## 1. What was built

| Area | Delivered |
|---|---|
| **Chat UI** | Next.js 16 + React 19, PartSelect branding (teal/gold), SSE streaming, rich message types: appliance cards, part cards (price / stock / compatibility badges), install-guide cards, cart drawer, address & payment forms, order confirmation |
| **Identity** | Email-or-guest at session start. Email loads purchase history; guests are lazily created and never blocked; typing a bare email mid-session switches accounts |
| **Personalization** | Owned appliances render as one-click cards; customers who only ever bought parts get appliance suggestions **inferred from part compatibility** ("Likely yours"); addresses pre-fill from the last order |
| **Vision** | 📷 upload a photo of the **model/serial nameplate** (Claude reads the model number) or a **broken part** (Claude identifies it) → routes straight into the model-lookup / part-search flow; rejects non-appliance photos |
| **Live fallback** | When a model or part isn't in the local catalog, fetch it from partselect.com, parse it, and **ingest it into the catalog** (self-growing KB); proxy-ready, graceful degradation |
| **Diagnosis** | Self-help troubleshooting first (RAG with source links), then replacement-part recommendations as confirmable cards |
| **Commerce** | Stock-aware part cards ("Only N left" / "Out of stock"), confirm-to-add cart, order summary, demo Visa payment (Luhn-validated, **no real charges**), transactional stock decrement (oversell-proof) |
| **Self-maintenance** | Cleaning/maintenance knowledge (clogged dishwasher filter rinse, cleaner-tablet cycles, descaling, condenser-coil cleaning) with cleaning supplies sold as parts |
| **Agent** | Claude (Sonnet 4.5) on Amazon Bedrock via the Claude Agent SDK, with 9 read-only MCP tools and a fully functional no-LLM degraded mode |
| **Retrieval** | Two-tier: exact SQL for structured facts, vector RAG (Titan Embeddings v2, pgvector-ready) with automatic keyword fallback |
| **Infra** | EC2 (nginx + systemd + Let's Encrypt TLS on a custom domain), RDS PostgreSQL provisioned for migration, Bedrock for LLM + embeddings |
| **Testing** | 43 end-to-end assertions covering every flow branch, the three case-study example queries, stock edge cases, guardrails, identity, and vision paths |

## 3. Agent design

### 3.1 Hybrid state machine + LLM — not a pure agent

The defining decision. The conversation is modeled as an explicit state machine
([stateMachine.ts](partselect-agent/src/server/stateMachine.ts)); the LLM is invoked at exactly **three nodes** where natural-language understanding is genuinely required:

1. **Fault diagnosis** — free-text symptom → troubleshooting steps → part recommendations
2. **Fuzzy part matching** — "the bin on the door for condiments" → candidate parts (and only after a deterministic search returned nothing)
3. **Free-form Q&A** — installation follow-ups, anything the intent shortcuts can't classify

Everything else — the three-button menu, "do you know the part number?", model collection, similar-option chips, cart, address, payment — is deterministic code emitting typed UI events. Consequences:

- **Token economy:** a full purchase flow costs ~2–4k tokens instead of ~20k for a pure-agent design. The two zero-token case-study examples (install lookup, compatibility check) literally never touch the LLM.
- **Latency:** fixed steps respond in milliseconds.
- **Predictability:** checkout can't be derailed by model drift.

Deterministic intent shortcuts run before the LLM on any free text: regex extraction of part numbers (`PS\d+`) and model numbers, plus keyword routing for install / compatibility / repair / purchase intents. The pronoun in *"Is **this part** compatible with my WDT780SAEM1?"* resolves from session state (`lastPartNos`), not from the model.

### 3.2 The harness: Claude Agent SDK on Bedrock

The agent runs on the **Claude Agent SDK** (`query()`), which provides the agentic loop, MCP tool dispatch, prompt caching, and streaming. On EC2 it authenticates to **Amazon Bedrock** (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`), so model access rides on AWS IAM — no third-party API keys in the serving path. The model is one env var (`AGENT_MODEL`), making vendor/model swaps a config change.

Session context is injected as a **one-line profile summary** ("User appliances: … Previously purchased parts: …") instead of replaying chat history — personalization at near-zero token cost.

### 3.3 Degraded mode: the demo never breaks

Every LLM node has a deterministic fallback (keyword RAG + templated copy + symptom search). If Bedrock is unreachable, the key is missing, or the model errors mid-call, the same flows complete — cards, checkout, everything. This is also why the system was fully demoable before Bedrock model access was approved.

### 3.4 Guardrails (three independent layers)

1. **Prompt scope-pin:** the system prompt restricts the assistant to refrigerator/dishwasher parts and mandates tool use for compatibility and diagnosis claims.
2. **Read-only tools:** the LLM physically cannot mutate state — cart adds, orders, and charges exist only behind user-confirmed UI events.
3. **Deterministic facts:** compatibility answers always come from the SQL compatibility matrix; the model narrates tool results, never invents them. Out-of-scope requests (tested live: "write me a poem") get a polite refusal in both LLM and degraded modes.

### 3.5 Vision input ([vision.ts](partselect-agent/src/server/vision.ts))

Model/serial nameplate strings (`WDT780SAEM1`) are painful to type and customers rarely know a part's name — so the most natural input in this domain is a photo. The 📷 button sends a (client-downscaled) image; the agent calls **Bedrock Converse with an image block** and the model returns one structured line — `MODEL: …`, `PART: … | refrigerator/dishwasher`, or `UNCLEAR: …` — which routes straight into the existing M-module (model lookup) or part search. Verified live: a Whirlpool nameplate photo resolves to `WRS325SDHZ01` and continues the flow; a non-appliance image is refused (the scope guardrail extends to vision). Degrades gracefully to "please type your model number" when no LLM is configured.

### 3.6 Live fallback & self-growing catalog ([liveFetch.ts](partselect-agent/src/server/liveFetch.ts))

When a model or part number misses the local catalog, the agent says *"Let me check PartSelect directly…"* and fetches the live page via a real browser engine (Playwright), parses it with the **same extraction logic that harvested the 620-part catalog**, ingests it (`ingestLivePart` / `ensureModel`), and answers from the now-present row — a knowledge base that grows with use.

**The honest operational caveat, documented because it matters:** partselect.com sits behind edge bot-protection that returns **HTTP 403 to datacenter IPs** — verified that even a real headless Chromium from our EC2 host gets "Access Denied". This is the *same wall* that breaks the competitors' HTTP scrapers. A reliable live fetch therefore needs a residential egress: set `SCRAPE_PROXY_URL` to a residential proxy and the real-browser engine passes. The feature is off by default (`LIVE_FETCH=1` to enable) and degrades cleanly to the catalog answer when the fetch is blocked — so on the EC2 demo the mechanism is present and proxy-ready, while the *owned* catalog is what makes the system robust regardless.

---

## 4. MCP design

### 4.1 Shape

Business capability lives in four plain-TypeScript service modules — [catalog](partselect-agent/src/server/services/catalog.ts), [orders](partselect-agent/src/server/services/orders.ts), [users](partselect-agent/src/server/services/users.ts), [payments](partselect-agent/src/server/services/payments.ts). A thin layer ([mcp/index.ts](partselect-agent/src/server/mcp/index.ts)) wraps a **read-only subset** of them into an in-process MCP server via the SDK's `createSdkMcpServer` + `tool()` with zod schemas:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_parts` | symptom/description → parts, optionally scoped to a model (compatible-only) |
| `get_part_details` | part number → details, price, stock, compatible models |
| `check_compatibility` | the **only** trusted compatibility source |
| `search_repair_guides` | RAG over the troubleshooting knowledge base |
| `get_install_guide` | structured guide: difficulty/time/tools/steps/video/manual |
| `find_similar_models` | close model numbers when lookup misses |
| `get_parts_for_model` | full compatible-parts list for a model |
| `get_order_status` / `get_recent_orders` | order inquiries for the current user |

### 4.2 Design principles

- **Single source of truth.** The state machine calls service functions directly (zero tokens); the agent reaches the *same functions* through MCP. One implementation, two consumers — fixing a query fixes both paths.
- **Writes are not tools.** `addToCart`, `createOrder`, `charge` are deliberately absent from the MCP surface. This is a mechanical safety guarantee, not a prompt-level promise.
- **Token-shaped results.** Tool outputs are trimmed projections (`slimPart`) — no raw rows, no unused columns — keeping tool-result context small.
- **In-process now, remote later.** SDK MCP servers run inside the Node process today (no subprocess/network overhead). Because MCP is a wire protocol, the same tool definitions can be lifted into standalone HTTP MCP services and scaled/deployed independently — or reused by entirely different clients (an internal support dashboard, Claude Desktop for support staff) without code changes to the tools themselves.

## 5. Database design & schema rationale

Schema: [schema.sql](partselect-agent/src/server/db/schema.sql). SQLite in development, ANSI-compatible SQL throughout so the planned RDS PostgreSQL migration only swaps the connection module (RDS instance already provisioned, pgvector-ready).

### 5.1 Why these tables

**`parts`** — the catalog core. Notable columns:
- `stock_qty` drives the entire inventory UX: "In stock" / "Only N left" (≤5) / "Out of stock" states, add-to-cart blocking, and transactional decrement at order time. Inventory lives in the database, not in prompt text, so the LLM can never "sell" a part that isn't there.
- `symptoms` (comma-separated phrases) makes parts *discoverable by problem* ("ice maker not working") rather than only by name — it powers deterministic symptom search with zero LLM involvement, and doubles as ranking signal (symptom hits outrank name hits).
- `part_no` (PartSelect number) is the universal foreign-key-by-convention the chat uses; `mfr_part_no` mirrors how real customers cross-reference manufacturer numbers.

**`appliance_models` + `compatibility`** — a classic many-to-many junction. Compatibility is **relational data, not text**, because "does it fit?" must be answered exactly — a wrong yes is a returned order. The junction also powers reverse queries cheaply: *parts for model* (pre-order browsing) and *models for part* — which is exactly how **appliance inference** works for parts-only customers (`purchased parts → compatibility → candidate models, ranked by match count`).

**`install_guides`** — deliberately a *separate structured table*, not text chunks. Difficulty, minutes, tools, and ordered steps are facts with stable shape; storing them structured means the install branch is a **zero-token SQL lookup** rendered directly as a card. Video/manual URLs are plain columns — links are payload, not semantics, so they are never embedded.

**`doc_chunks`** — the unstructured second tier (repair guides, manual excerpts, video transcripts). Each chunk carries `symptom_tags` (retrieval signal), `source_url` + `source_ref` (page/timestamp — answers cite their sources), and an `embedding` BLOB (Float32; becomes `vector(1024)` under pgvector, where in-process cosine is replaced by the `<=>` operator). The two-tier split — *structured facts in SQL, fuzzy knowledge in vectors* — is the schema-level expression of the agent design: exact questions get exact answers, fuzzy questions get retrieval.

**`users` / `user_appliances`** — identity and the personalization loop. `user_appliances.source` is a tiny enum doing real work: `purchased` (owned — survives any update), `searched` (confirmed in a session), and inference happens at query time rather than being stored — so suggestions always reflect current compatibility data. Guests are just rows with `email = NULL`, which is why guest mode required no schema change.

**`carts` / `orders` / `order_items`** — standard commerce normalization with two deliberate choices: `order_items.unit_price` **snapshots the price at purchase time** (catalog prices change; order history must not), and order creation runs in a **single transaction** that re-validates stock, decrements it, writes the order, clears the cart, and upgrades the session appliance to `purchased` — the oversell race is closed at the database layer, not in application hope.

**`search_history`** — append-only behavioral log feeding the profile summary and future analytics (e.g., "searched a model twice but never bought" → low-confidence appliance ownership).

### 5.2 Why SQLite → PostgreSQL, and not a separate vector DB

At catalog scale (10²–10⁴ parts) a dedicated vector database adds an operational dependency for no measurable gain. pgvector keeps vectors **in the same database as the filters** — one SQL statement can combine `appliance_type = 'dishwasher' AND part_id = …` with similarity ranking. The `EmbeddingProvider` interface (Titan v2 on Bedrock in prod, optional local model offline, `none` → keyword fallback) keeps the retrieval layer swappable without touching callers.

### 5.3 What the database looks like *today* (SQLite, pre-migration)

To be precise about current state: **the system — including the production EC2 deployment — currently runs entirely on SQLite** (one WAL-mode file, `data/partselect.db`). RDS PostgreSQL is provisioned but not yet wired in (tracked as the next engineering task). The *logical* schema is identical on both engines; what changes at migration time is dialect, not design.

**Entity-relationship overview:**

```
appliance_models ──< compatibility >── parts ───1:1─── install_guides
      (18)             (938 pairs)      (664)              (13)
        │                                │ │
        │                                │ └───< doc_chunks (16; optional part link,
        │                                │        embedding BLOB → 1024-d Titan vectors)
        │                                │
        └──< user_appliances >── users   └──< order_items >── orders ──> users
                  (3)            (4 + guests)     (5)           (4)
                                   │
                                   ├──< search_history   (appended per query)
                                   └──< carts            (cleared on checkout)
```

**Current contents (seed + real-data ingest; production also accumulates guest users, searches, and live orders):**

| Table | Rows | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `appliance_models` | 18 | 9 refrigerators + 9 dishwashers, 7 brands |
| `parts` | 664 | **~620 real parts ingested from partselect.com** — the complete catalogs of 5 fully-harvested models (real PS numbers, prices, stock, names) — plus synthetic seed incl. 2 zero-stock demo parts and 3 cleaning supplies |
| `compatibility` | 938 | part↔model pairs — the only compatibility authority |
| `install_guides` | 13 | structured: difficulty / minutes / tools / steps / links; 6 enriched with real difficulty, time, and YouTube videos from partselect.com |
| `doc_chunks` | 16 | repair + maintenance knowledge; all 16 embedded with Titan v2 (1024-d) in production |
| `users` | 4 | demo / sarah / mike / lisa sample personas (+ guests at runtime) |
| `user_appliances` | 3 | demo×2 owned, sarah×1 owned; mike/lisa intentionally empty → inference demo |
| `orders` / `order_items` | 4 / 5 | seeded purchase histories powering personalization |

**Real-data ingestion (implemented).** `npm run db:seed && npm run ingest` replays the harvested catalogs ([data/ingested/](partselect-agent/data/ingested/)) through [scripts/ingest-real.ts](partselect-agent/scripts/ingest-real.ts): the **complete parts catalogs of 5 real models** — WDT780SAEM1 (155), WRS325SDHZ01 (254), WDF520PADM7 (138), WRF555SDFZ09 (232), MDB4949SHZ (153) — paginated to the last page, ~800 listings deduplicating to ~620 unique parts. Real data overwrites synthetic data by part number; invented part numbers whose manufacturer numbers matched real parts were remapped in place (row ids preserved, so order history keeps its foreign keys) or removed when stale. Notably, partselect.com returns **HTTP 403 to plain HTTP scrapers** (verified with curl and two server-side fetchers), so the harvest runs through a real browser session using same-origin `fetch` — see §11 for why this matters.

**Is PostgreSQL "the same"?** Logically yes — tables, keys, and constraints carry over unchanged. The mechanical dialect differences that constitute the migration work:

| SQLite (today) | PostgreSQL (target) |
|---|---|
| `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` | `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` |
| `TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))` | `timestamptz DEFAULT now()` |
| `embedding BLOB` (Float32 LE) | `embedding vector(1024)` + HNSW index |
| cosine computed in-process (rag.ts) | `ORDER BY embedding <=> $1` in SQL |
| `COLLATE NOCASE` lookups | `citext` column type or `ILIKE` |
| `better-sqlite3` synchronous driver | `pg` async pool — the real refactor surface |

---

## 6. Extensibility & scalability

| Change | Touch points |
|---|---|
| New appliance category (ovens) | seed data + the `appliance_type` enum — flows, tools, and UI are category-agnostic |
| New capability (returns, warranty) | one new service module + MCP tool registration |
| Real payments | replace the payments adapter (interface already shaped like a gateway) |
| Different LLM vendor/model | one env var (Agent SDK abstracts the provider) |
| Real authentication | insert a verification step (magic link / OTP) after `identifyUser` — the seam exists |
| Horizontal scale | session Map → Redis (one file); in-process MCP → standalone HTTP MCP services; SQLite → RDS (connection module swap); stateless Next.js behind a load balancer |
| Real PartSelect data | the seed script *is* the ingestion contract — point a scraper at the same arrays |

Protocol-first design helps everywhere: the typed `ClientEvent`/`ServerEvent` contract ([protocol.ts](partselect-agent/src/shared/protocol.ts)) is shared by frontend and backend, so new card types or actions are one type + one renderer + one state-machine case.

---

## 7. Conversation flow (implemented)

- **Open:** email / guest choice (guests are lazily created on first action — never blocked) → personalized appliance cards (owned, or inferred from purchased parts) → three-button menu + free-text fallback
- **Broken:** collect model (M module: not found → similar options → apology) → symptom description → troubleshooting steps with sources → part cards
- **Pre-order:** known part number → exact lookup; unknown → model + description → deterministic search first, LLM only on miss
- **Install:** part number or pick from purchased parts → structured guide card (zero tokens) → fuzzy follow-ups to the agent → "order this part too?"
- **P module everywhere:** price shown up front, user confirms before cart; low-stock and out-of-stock states; similar-part chips; apology fallback
- **Checkout:** summary confirmation → address (pre-filled) → demo Visa (4-prefix + 16 digits + Luhn) → transactional order → history feeds next session's cards

## 8. Case-study examples (all verified, see [test-flow.ts](partselect-agent/scripts/test-flow.ts))

| Query | Path | LLM? |
|---|---|---|
| "How can I install part number PS11752778?" | intent shortcut → SQL install card | No — 0 tokens |
| "Is this part compatible with my WDT780SAEM1?" | pronoun resolution → compatibility matrix → not compatible (fridge part) | No — 0 tokens |
| "The ice maker on my Whirlpool fridge is not working…" | repair intent → model collection → RAG + diagnosis → part cards | diagnosis node |
| "My dishwasher is clogged, how do I clean it?" | diagnosis → self-maintenance guide (filter rinse, cleaner cycle) + cleaning supplies as purchasable parts | diagnosis node |
| "Write me a poem" | guardrails → polite refusal | — |

## 9. Running locally

```bash
cd partselect-agent
npm install
npm run db:seed     # SQLite + synthetic seed
npm run ingest      # merge real partselect.com data (18 models / 664 parts / 938 compat pairs total)
npm run dev         # http://localhost:3000  (fully functional with no API keys)
npm run test:flow   # 41 end-to-end assertions
```

Optional: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` for the live LLM; `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=bedrock npm run embed` for vector retrieval.

## 10. Deployment (us-east-2) & next steps

EC2 t3.small (nginx → systemd-managed Next.js, Let's Encrypt TLS, Elastic IP) · Bedrock via IAM-scoped credentials · RDS PostgreSQL provisioned. Resource inventory: `DEPLOY-INFO.md`.

Known next steps: SQLite→RDS migration (async pg refactor of the service layer), verified authentication, real catalog ingestion.

## 11. Comparison with public reference implementations

We studied two public attempts and benchmarked against the stronger of the two. Facts below come from their source code and (where available) the authors' own slides.

### 11a. vs [gmunhoz0810/PartSelect-LLM-Assistant](https://github.com/gmunhoz0810/PartSelect-LLM-Assistant)

GPT-4o + FastAPI, documented in the author's slide deck.

**Its design in one line:** a pure agent — every query goes through GPT-4o with 4 OpenAI function-calling tools that **scrape partselect.com in real time** (BeautifulSoup over CSS selectors); SQLite is used only to log conversation history; the frontend is a non-streaming chat on GitHub Pages.

| Dimension | This project | Reference implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope vs. the brief** | Information **and transactions**: cart, stock, checkout, payment, order history — the brief explicitly asks to "assist with customer transactions" | Information lookup only; author confirms no cart/checkout — buying happens on partselect.com |
| **Architecture** | Hybrid state machine + agent; LLM touched only at 3 fuzzy nodes | Pure agent; every query (even "info about PS11752778") is an LLM round-trip |
| **Cost / latency profile** | Deterministic paths: 0 tokens, milliseconds. Two of the three case-study examples never invoke the LLM | Author's own numbers: ~7 s average, 9–13 s for model queries; every query pays GPT-4o |
| **Data layer** | Owned transactional catalog: stock authority, oversell-proof orders, price snapshots | No catalog at all — author's slides: *"Very dependent on current PS website html structure"*; one CSS redesign breaks every tool |
| **Compatibility answers** | Relational matrix, exact SQL | Scraped from PS pages (accurate while the HTML holds) |
| **RAG** | Two-tier: structured SQL + vector retrieval (Titan/pgvector path) with source citations and keyword fallback | None — repair content scraped per request |
| **Identity & personalization** | Email/guest accounts, purchase history, appliance cards, **appliance inference from purchased parts**, address pre-fill | None (anonymous, capped 50-message history) |
| **UX** | SSE streaming; interactive components (part cards with stock badges, confirm-to-cart, forms) | Non-streaming text/markdown; author notes ~1% of responses render media incorrectly |
| **Resilience** | Degraded no-LLM mode completes every flow; guardrails are mechanical (read-only tools) | Hard dependency on OpenAI availability + PS HTML stability; guardrails are prompt-level |
| **Tool layer** | 9 read-only MCP tools (open standard, reusable by other clients, liftable to remote services) | 4 bespoke OpenAI function definitions; author lists "only has 4 LLM tools" as a limitation |
| **Testing** | 41 automated end-to-end assertions in CI-runnable script | Manual spot checks ("10/10 tries correct" on one query) |
| **Deployment** | Own domain + TLS on AWS (EC2/nginx/systemd), Bedrock via IAM | GitHub Pages frontend + locally-run backend (Procfile present) |

**Where the reference implementation is genuinely stronger — and our answer.** Real-time scraping gives it the *entire* live PartSelect catalog (~2M parts, fresh prices) with zero storage. That is a real advantage for breadth, and we say so plainly. But it is also a ceiling: a scraper can read pages, yet it can never hold stock authority, write an order, or guarantee compatibility after a markup change — which is why that design *cannot* satisfy the transactional half of the brief, and why its author lists HTML-dependence as his first negative.

That brittleness is no longer hypothetical: **as of 2026-06-11, partselect.com returns HTTP 403 to plain HTTP clients** (verified with curl and two independent server-side fetchers). The reference implementation's per-request scraping would not function against today's site, while this system keeps answering from its owned catalog. We closed the breadth gap from the other direction: the **ingestion contract is implemented** ([scripts/ingest-real.ts](partselect-agent/scripts/ingest-real.ts)) — the complete catalogs of 5 real models (~620 unique parts with real PartSelect numbers, prices, and stock states, plus real symptom lists, difficulty ratings, and installation videos for the hero parts) were harvested through a real browser session, which passes the bot protection that blocks HTTP scrapers, and merged into the transactional schema. Breadth *and* freshness on top of a commerce agent — not instead of one.

### 11b. vs [annielouu/ecommerce_chat_agent](https://github.com/annielouu/ecommerce_chat_agent)

The stronger of the two — also on the **Claude Agent SDK** (claude-haiku-4-5, beta `tool_runner`), with ChromaDB RAG, a self-growing knowledge base (`fetch_page` caches fetched pages), Playwright-stealth scraping across 5 brand domains via Serper web search, a scope guardrail, **and a vision variant** (`AppWithVision.js`). It is a genuinely good *research/retrieval* agent. What it explicitly does not do (per its README): cart, checkout, user accounts, streaming.

When we first compared, it had two features we lacked — **vision** and **live web-search fallback**. We closed both:

| Feature it had that we didn't | Status now |
|---|---|
| Vision (photo input) | ✅ Implemented (§3.5) — model-sticker reading + part identification via Bedrock Converse, verified live; with the scope guardrail extended to images |
| Live fetch + self-growing KB | ✅ Implemented (§3.6) — catalog-miss → live partselect fetch → ingest → answer; proxy-ready, graceful degradation |

So the retrieval-side gap is closed, while the **commerce, identity, inventory-authority, streaming, deployment, and automated-testing** advantages remain ours. Two notes in fairness: its Serper integration searches *multiple brand domains* (whirlpool.com, samsung.com, …) where ours is partselect-scoped; and its self-growing KB uses a dedicated ChromaDB store where ours grows the relational catalog (a deliberate choice — our growth is transactionally usable, not just retrievable). Net: the two projects are different species — a retrieval agent and a commerce agent — and for a brief whose stated primary functions are "provide product information **and assist with customer transactions**," ours covers both halves while matching its retrieval headline features.
